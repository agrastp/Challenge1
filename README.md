# Challenge1- Horiseon Webpage

## Description

This project motivated me as a future developer in researching and learning more about semantic html elements and how to use selectors in CSS.  I built this project to make the website more accessible and understandable when looking at the code.  It helps other developers to look at the code in an effective and usable way.  I learned more about how html is laid out, learned how to apply and consolidate class/ID selctors, and how to use commenting to add more direction to others looking at my work.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This project can be used as a great demonstration of how to use semantic language in html, how to order information in a logical manner, how to apply class/ID selctors, and how to consolidate code so it is easier to navigate.  Code smarter, not harder!
